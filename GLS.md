# Global Listing Seller Stuck Order  
**Technologies:** Java, AWS, Spring Boot, Selenium  

## Overview  
The **Global Listing Seller Stuck Order** project focused on **restructuring a global order tracking platform** to support **100,000+ listings**, improving visibility, resiliency, and seller experience. The initiative was critical to ensuring operational stability during **peak P90 demand weeks**, where high order volumes could lead to multi-million-dollar losses without robust monitoring and intervention mechanisms.  

---

## Problem Context & Root Cause Analysis  
### Key Challenges:  
1. **Order Visibility Gaps:** Sellers lacked real-time insights into stuck or delayed orders.  
2. **Critical Peak Period Failures:** During the P90 week (peak load), tracking failures risked **$9.5M in unfulfilled orders**.  
3. **Inefficient Complaint Management:** Manual complaint resolution processes created bottlenecks, increasing seller dissatisfaction.  
4. **Scalability Constraints:** The existing tracking platform couldnâ€™t efficiently scale to **100,000+ listings**.  

### Root Causes Identified:  
- **Lack of Distributed Tracking Logic:** Order data synchronization relied on batch updates instead of real-time processing.  
- **Monitoring Gaps:** No automated alerting or proactive diagnostics to detect failures early.  
- **Complaint System Architecture Limitations:** The complaint platform lacked concurrent request handling and prioritization logic.  

---

## Technical Solution Design  

### 1. **Backend Restructuring with Spring Boot**
- Migrated monolithic components to a **Spring Boot microservices architecture**, improving scalability and maintainability.  
- Introduced **asynchronous message queues (Amazon SQS)** to ensure real-time updates and reduce latency in stuck order detection.  
- Created **REST APIs** for real-time visibility into stuck order states for sellers and operations teams.  

---

### 2. **AWS Cloud Integration**
- Hosted microservices on **AWS ECS** for containerized deployments with auto-scaling policies.  
- Leveraged **Amazon DynamoDB** for storing high-volume order metadata and stuck order states.  
- Integrated **AWS Lambda** for periodic stuck order reconciliations and proactive checks.  
- Configured **CloudWatch Alarms** for system health metrics and proactive failure detection.  

---

### 3. **Selenium for Automated Regression Testing**
- Built a **comprehensive Selenium test suite** to simulate seller order flows and validate stuck order recovery.  
- Automated test execution in **CI/CD pipelines** for early defect detection and reduced release risks.  

---

### 4. **Complaint Management System Enhancements**
- Redesigned backend workflows to support **priority queues** for high-severity cases.  
- Integrated **Amazon RDS** with optimized query patterns to handle large volumes of concurrent seller complaints.  
- Introduced **async workflows** to reduce complaint resolution SLAs by over 40%.
